# Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service For Developers

Welcome to the Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service for Developers workshop.  These labs discuss the challenges of Alphaoffice, a fictitious company with real business challenges. Alphaoffice has been challenged to manage large volumes of customer data, and to support marketing projects that have a need to understand potential customer spend habits and ability and interest to purchase Alphaoffice products.  This workshop provides as series of hands on labs that help solve Alphaoffice's challenges and give you a basic understanding of the Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service and how it vastly simplifies management of data and development of applications that access large volumes of data. Lab 100 will introduce you to ADWC and show you how to create a ADWC service. Lab 200 will show how developers and dbas can access billions of rows of data in seconds without needing to design in performance. Lab 300 shows you you can use ADWC's Machine Learning to predict customer good credit given detailed demographic information.  Finally lab 400 shows how you can visualize patterns in data, and run ad-hoc queries to discover patterns in the data.
