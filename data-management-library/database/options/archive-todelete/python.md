## Lab Introduction 
This lab guide shows how to program a very simple Python script, connect to a database and retrieve information from the database.
 
**Lab Assumptions**  
- Each participant has been provided a username and password to the tenancy c4u03  
- Each participant has completed the Environment Setup lab.

## Section 1 - Lab Setup

Python comes preinstalled on most Linux distributions, and it is available as a package on others. The Python packages can be obtained from the software repository of your Linux distribution using the package manager. There are two Python versions available, 2.X and 3.X, the VM used for this lab comes preinstalled with Python 2.7 but since this version will reach the end of support on January 1st, 2020, we will use Python3 for this excercise. 

1. Open up a terminal and ssh into your compute instance as the opc user

        ssh -i optionskey opc@<your ip address>

2.	Check if python3 has been installed by running the command

        sudo yum -y install python3 python3-tools

    The system will either install packages or let you know they are already installed.

## Section 2 - Python Programming

There are several ways to execute Python code.  In this section we start with two examples on how to execute Python code from the command line. The first example executing code from the command prompt i.e. executing commands directly in the interpreter. The second example to save your code in a .py file and invoke the interpreter to execute the file.

1. To execute code from command line open the Python command line editor and type the following commands, one by one (each line is one command): 

        $ python3
        >>> var1 = "hello world"
        >>> var1
        'hello world'

2.  To create a simple script, open up a text editor (like vi) and enter the following script.

        var1 = "hello world"
        print(var1)

    Save the file as test.py in the /home/oracle directory.

        $ python3 /home/oracle/test.py

        hello world

## Section 3 - Install Python Oracle module and connect

cx\_Oracle is a python module that enables access to Oracle databases.  This module is supported by Oracle 11.2 and higher and works for both Python 2.X and 3.X. There are various ways in which cx\_Oracle can be installed. In this example we will use pip (installed by default for python 3.4 and up). For more ways to install cx\_Oracle (like yum) check the documentation on [https://yum.oracle.com/oracle-linux-python.html#Aboutcx_Oracle](https://yum.oracle.com/oracle-linux-python.html#Aboutcx_Oracle "documentation").

1.  Become the Oracle user

    Since our client libraries are installed in our VM under the oracle user, we will now 'sudo' into the oracle user. (If you have an environment that does not have client libraries accessible to the user running the python3 script, install the Oracle instant client as described in the documentation)

        sudo su - oracle

2.  Install cx_Oracle using pip

    Install the module using python3 and pip for the oracle user:

        python3 -m pip install --user cx_Oracle

3.  Test your install by launching the python console and list the available modules

        $. oraenv
        ORACLE_SID = [ORCL] ? ORCL
        The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /u01/app/oracle

        $ python3
        >>> help('modules')

    This command will show you a list of installed modules which should include the cx\_Oracle module we installed in the previous step.


4.  Connect to the Oracle database and print the version of the database via python.  
    (This confirms you are connected to an Oracle instance and returns the database version) 


        >>> import cx_Oracle
        >>> con = cx_Oracle.connect('system/Ora_DB4U@localhost:1521/orclpdb')
        >>> print(con.version)
         
        19.5.0.0.0 (example output)

        >>> quit()

## Section 4 - Querying the Oracle database
    
Retrieving records from Oracle database using cursors is a simple as embedding the SQL statement within the cursor().execute statement. For this example we will use an existing table that was imported for the In-Memory lab.

1.  Create a script called /home/oracle/db_connect.py witht he following contents:

        import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect('ssb/Ora_DB4U@localhost:1521/orclpdb')

        cur = con.cursor()
        cur.execute('select c_name,c_address,c_city from customer where rownum < 100')

        for row in cur:
          print (row)

        cur.close()

        con.close()

2.  Execute the script and check the result:

        python3 /home/oracle/db_connect.py

    The result should be a list of customers.

Congratulations!  You've created a basic python application connecting to the oracle database.
