# Create Graph as Files #

Initial description 

## Disclaimer ##
The following is intended to outline our general product direction. It is intended for information purposes only, and may not be incorporated into any contract. It is not a commitment to deliver any material, code, or functionality, and should not be relied upon in making purchasing decisions. The development, release, and timing of any features or functionality described for Oracleâ€™s products remains at the sole discretion of Oracle.


## Data Preparation
Go to `graphs/customer_360/` directory.

```$ <copy>cd graphs/customer_360/</copy>```

Check the following files. Those datasets are collected from different data sources, and converted to graph data format. Here, we use `.pg` format (detail).

    $ more master.pg
    $ more purchase.pg
    $ more transfer.pg
    
`master.pg`


```

`transfer.pg`

```
# Nodes
211 type:account account_no:xxx-zzz-001
212 type:account account_no:xxx-zzz-002

# Edges
201 -> 202 :transfer amount:200 date:"2018-10-05"
211 -> 202 :transfer amount:900 date:"2018-10-06"
202 -> 212 :transfer amount:850 date:"2018-10-06"
201 -> 203 :transfer amount:500 date:"2018-10-07"
203 -> 204 :transfer amount:450 date:"2018-10-08"
204 -> 201 :transfer amount:400 date:"2018-10-09"
202 -> 203 :transfer amount:100 date:"2018-10-10"
202 -> 201 :transfer amount:300 date:"2018-10-10"
```

## Data Integration
We can simply concatenate the files.

    $ <copy>cat master.pg purchase.pg transfer.pg > all.pg</copy>

![](images/all.jpg)


## Data Conversion
Convert the data into PGX format using pg2pgx tool ([detail](https://pg-format.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents/pg-converters.html)).

    $ <copy>alias pg2pgx='docker run --rm -v $PWD:/work g2glab/pg:0.3.4 pg2pgx</copy>'
    
    $ <copy>pg2pgx all.pg</copy>

    "all.pgx.nodes" has been created.
    "all.pgx.edges" has been created.
    "all.pgx.json" has been created.

You will get the separate files for nodes and edges.
    
    $ more all.pgx.nodes
    $ more all.pgx.edges

## Next Step

Next step is [Load from Files](../load_from_files/load_from_files.md).
