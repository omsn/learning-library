# Workshop Introduction and Overview                                    

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to get started using the **Oracle Autonomous Database on Shared Infrastructure (ADB-S)**. You will provision a new ADB instance, load data from the object store and troubleshoot data loads, query external data residing on the object store, manage an ADB instance, and scale an ADB instance.

With Oracle Autonomous Database we make it quick and easy for you to create a secure, fully managed database service in the Oracle Cloud which allows you to start loading and analyzing your data immediately.

## What is an Autonomous Database?
Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse and Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing are built around the market leading Oracle database and come with fully automated data warehouse and transaction processing specific features that deliver outstanding query performance. This environment is delivered as a fully managed cloud service running on optimized high-end Oracle hardware systems.  You don’t need to spend time thinking about how you should store your data, when or how to back it up or how to tune your queries. We take care of everything for you.

Oracle’s Autonomous Database is the perfect quick-start service for fast data loading and sophisticated data reporting and analysis. Oracle manages everything for you so you can focus on your data.

## Workshop Objectives
- Get comfortable with Oracle's public cloud services
- Provision a new Autonomous Database instance on Shared Infrastructure
- Run sample queries against the sample data sets
- Load data from the object store
- Query external data from the object store
- Scale an ADB instance

## Lab Breakdown
- **Lab 1:** Log in to Oracle Cloud and access the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse console.
- **Lab 2:** Provision your first Autonomous Data Warehouse.
- **Lab 3:** Explore the provided sample data sets that come with your Autonomous Database.
- **Lab 4:** Upload files to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Object Storage, create sample tables, load data into them from files on the OCI Object Storage, and troubleshoot data loads with errors.
- **Lab 5:** Query files on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage (OCI) directly without loading them to your database.
- **Lab 6:** Scale up your Oracle Autonomous Database service to have more CPUs.
